## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio-timer = "0.1"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```rust
extern crate tokio_timer;
```

## What is tokio-timer?

This crate provides timer facilities for usage with Tokio. Currently,
the only timer implementation is a hashed timing wheel, but will provide
a binary heap based timer at some point.

A timer provides the ability to set a timeout, represented as a future.
When the timeout is reached, the future completes. This can be
implemented very efficiently and avoiding runtime allocations.

### Hashed Timing Wheel

Inspired by the [paper by Varghese and
Lauck](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nahum/w6998/papers/ton97-timing-wheels.pdf),
the hashed timing wheel is a great choice for the usage pattern commonly
found when writing network applications.
